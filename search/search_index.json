REST was designed to be a more straightforward and easy to implement alternative to heavyweight SOAP for web service access. SOAP functions well in distributed environments where REST assumes a direct point to point communication. Also, SOAP allows for services to describe themselves to clients and in some languages allows for automation. On the other hand, REST is fast as less processing is required, uses less bandwidth and is closer to technologies used in web design. The choice on which to use is totally dependent on what the requirement. For example, SOAP is a better choice for applications that have complex API so as to describe the services and methods, where formal contracts are agreed for the exchange format, where a guaranteed level of security is required etc. REST will be preferred when limiting bandwidth and resources, when operations are can be stateless and the information can be cached.

Crunchy Data Postgres Operator in OpenShift 4. Overview & Proof of Concept \u00b6 In earlier days, Red Hat recommended running PostgreSQL database outside the Kubernetes cluster. Now, with Kubernetes Operator technology, you can run stateful database applications on Kubernetes. Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator extends Kubernetes to give you the power to easily create, configure and manage PostgreSQL clusters at scale. When combined with the Crunchy PostgreSQL Container Suite , the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator provides an open source software solution for PostgreSQL scaling, high-availability, disaster recovery, monitoring, and more. All of this capability comes with the repeatability and automation that comes from Operators on Kubernetes. Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator is open source and developed in close collaboration with users to support enterprise deployments of cloud agnostic PostgreSQL-as-a-Service capability. This release comes after extensive feedback from our customers and the community to ensure the scalability and security that sysadmins, DBAs, and developers have come to rely on. Crunchy PostgreSQL and Openshift Crunchy Postgres Solutions: Postgres Operator Community Edition : \u2018pgo\u2019 CLI tool Not certified by Red Hat The Operator can be deployed by multiple methods including: The PostgreSQL Operator Installer with kubectl Install Operator Using Bash (the one used in this overview) Ansible playbook installation CLI installation using OLM (Deprecated) : new CatalogSource added via \u201cpgo.catalogsource.yaml\u201d. Openshift Console installation using OLM (OperatorHub): New CatalogSource requirement. CLI settings required. Certified Crunchydata Postgres Operator (OLM/OperatorHub): Openshift Console installation using OLM (OperatorHub): One-click deployment and Web based operation No \u2018pgo\u2019 CLI tool? (compatibility issues: unable to find in github the version that matches the server API - Sept 2019) Certified by Red Hat Provided by CrunchyData Other non-certified installations (unsupported by Red Hat): with or without OLM, CLI, etc. Crunchy Containers Community Edition : Installation: Installation guide Pgadmin4 install (easy) Not certified by Red Hat Crunchydata Postgres Operator 3.5 \u00b6 Release date: Januay 2019 pgBackRest Architecture Enhancements pgBackRest Point-In-Time-Recovery Fast Failover Archive Storage Configuration Preferred Failover Node Label pgo-scheduler Crunchydata Postgres Operator 4.0.1 \u00b6 Release date: June 2019 Namespace Deployment Options: Ability to deploy the operator its own namespace but manage PostgreSQL clusters in multiple namespace. The new namespace management features lets users create multi-tenant PostgreSQL environments that add further isolation and security to their deployments. Further Enhancements to pgBackRest Integration: Perform pgBackRest backups to Amazon S3 . This allows users to create an automated, geographically distributed, and hybrid cloud disaster recovery strategy. Integrated PostgreSQL Benchmarking Ansible Playbook Based Installation Operator Lifecycle Management (OLM): The OLM project is a component of the Operator Framework, an open source toolkit to manage Operators, in an effective, automated, and scalable way. OLM concepts were included into Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator to assist in the deployment on Kubernetes using OLM integration. Crunchydata Postgres Operator 4.0.1 Community Edition \u00b6 Service Accounts \u00b6 Service accounts give us flexibility to control access to API without sharing user\u2019s credentials. Service Accounts are also used by pods and other non-human actors to perform various actions and are a central vehicle by which their access to resources is managed. By default, three service accounts are created in each project: Builder: Used by build pods and assigned the system:image-builder role, which grants push capability into the internal registry to any image stream in the project. Deployer: Used by deploy pods and assigned the system:deployer role , which allows modifying replication controllers in the project. Default: Used by all other pods by default. You can see them by running the following command: oc get serviceaccounts oc get sa Running a Pod with a Different Service Account. You can run a pod with a service account other than the default: Edit the deployment configuration: $ oc edit dc/<deployment_config> Add the serviceAccount and serviceAccountName parameters to the spec field, and specify the service account you want to use: spec: securityContext: {} serviceAccount: <service_account> serviceAccountName: <service_account> Refs: ref1 ref2 ref3 Each service account is represented by the ServiceAccount resource and is associated with two additional secrets for access to the OpenShift API and the internal registry: $ oc describe serviceaccounts/default Name: default Namespace: pgouser1 Labels: <none> Annotations: <none> Image pull secrets: default-dockercfg-nrhwt Mountable secrets: default-token-vm8b5 default-dockercfg-nrhwt Tokens: default-token-p6rhz default-token-vm8b5 Events: <none> The service account can be created and deleted with a simple command: oc create sa myserviceaccount oc delete sa/myserviceaccount Every service account is also a member of two groups: system:serviceaccounts , which includes all service accounts in the cluster system:serviceaccounts:<project> , which includes all service accounts in the project Roles assigned to Service Accounts \u00b6 When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the default service account in the same namespace. If you get the raw json or yaml for a pod you have created (e.g. oc get pods/podname -o yaml ), you can see the spec.serviceAccountName field has been automatically set. You can grant privileges to groups of service accounts, which will effectively grant those privileges to all accounts in the group: $ oc adm policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n myproject role \"view\" added: \"system:serviceaccounts\" For example, to grant view privileges to all service accounts in the cluster in the project myproject: $ oc adm policy remove-role-from-group view system:serviceaccounts \u2013n myproject role \"view\" removed: \"system:serviceaccounts\" Security Context Constraints (SCC) \u00b6 Security Context Constraints (SCCs) control what actions pods can perform and what resources they can access. SCCs combine a set of security configurations into a single policy object that can be applied to pods. These security configurations include, but are not limited to, Linux Capabilities, Seccomp Profiles, User and Group ID Ranges, and types of mounts. OpenShift ships with several SCCs: The most constrained is the restricted SCC , and the least constrained is the privileged SCC : oc edit scc restricted oc edit scc privileged The other SCCs provide intermediate levels of constraint for various use cases. The restricted SCC is granted to all authenticated users by default. The default SCC for most pods should be the restricted SCC. If required, a cluster administrator may allow certain pods to run with different SCCs . Pods should be run with the most restrictive SCC possible. Pods inherit their SCC from the Service Account used to run the pod . With the default project template, new projects get a Service Account named default that is used to run pods. This default service account is only granted the ability to run the restricted SCC. SCC Recommendations \u00b6 Use OpenShift\u2019s Security Context Constraint feature, which has been contributed to Kubernetes as Pod Security Policies (PSP) . PSPs are still beta in Kubernetes 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13, 1.14, 1.15 . Use the restricted SCC as the default For pods that require additional access, use the SCC that grants the least amount of additional privileges or create a custom SCC Remediation: Apply the SCC with the least privilege required Audit: To show all available SCCs: oc describe scc To audit a single pod: oc describe pod <POD> | grep openshift.io\\/scc openshift.io/scc: restricted Problem: Default SCC is \u201crestricted\u201d SCC -> Crunchydata Postgres Cluster PODs are not rolled out oc get rs : oc describe rs mycluster5-lgyb-84b58f5dd9 : Warning FailedCreate 3m24s (x17 over 7m30s) replicaset-controller Error creating: pods \u201cmycluster5-lgyb-84b58f5dd9-\u201d is forbidden: unable to validate against any security context constraint: [fsGroup: Invalid value: []int64{26}: 26 is not an allowed group] Add a SCC to a Project \u00b6 SCCs are not granted directly to a project. Instead, you add a service account to an SCC and either specify the service account name on your pod or, when unspecified, run as the default service account. To add a SCC to a user: oc adm policy add-scc-to-group <scc_name> <group_name> To add a SCC to all service accounts in a namespace: oc adm policy add-scc-to-group <scc_name> system:serviceaccounts:<serviceaccount_namespace> If you are currently in the project to which the service account belongs, you can use the -z flag and just specify the serviceaccount_name : oc adm policy add-scc-to-user <scc_name> -z <serviceaccount_name> Examples: oc describe scc anyuid oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:serviceaccounts:pgouser1 \u2018default\u2019 serviceAccount: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccounts:pgouser1:default User registered in Identity Provider: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid myuser Custom serviceAccount: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccounts:pgouser1:my-sa Refs: ref1 ref2 ref3 \ud83c\udf1f Workflow1 without custom Service Account and without DeploymentConfig \u00b6 Workflow2 with custom Service Account and without DeploymentConfig \u00b6 Create a custom ServiceAccount and add a role to it within a Project: oc project pgouser1 oc get scc oc create serviceaccount my-sa \u2013n pgouser1 oc describe sa my-sa oc get scc oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid system:serviceaccount:pgouser1:my-sa oc policy add-role-to-user edit system:serviceaccount:pgouser1:my-sa Alternative to step #6: oc edit scc anyuid users: - system:serviceaccount:pgouser1:my-sa Other commands of interest: oc get role oc describe role pgo-role oc edit role pgo-role References: ref1 ref2 ref3 Workflow3 with custom service Account and DeploymentConfig \u00b6 Environment setup.

Now, with Kubernetes Operator technology, you can run stateful database applications on Kubernetes. Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator extends Kubernetes to give you the power to easily create, configure and manage PostgreSQL clusters at scale. When combined with the Crunchy PostgreSQL Container Suite , the Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator provides an open source software solution for PostgreSQL scaling, high-availability, disaster recovery, monitoring, and more. All of this capability comes with the repeatability and automation that comes from Operators on Kubernetes. Crunchy PostgreSQL Operator is open source and developed in close collaboration with users to support enterprise deployments of cloud agnostic PostgreSQL-as-a-Service capability. This release comes after extensive feedback from our customers and the community to ensure the scalability and security that sysadmins, DBAs, and developers have come to rely on.

Deployer: Used by deploy pods and assigned the system:deployer role , which allows modifying replication controllers in the project. Default: Used by all other pods by default. You can see them by running the following command: oc get serviceaccounts oc get sa Running a Pod with a Different Service Account. You can run a pod with a service account other than the default: Edit the deployment configuration: $ oc edit dc/<deployment_config> Add the serviceAccount and serviceAccountName parameters to the spec field, and specify the service account you want to use: spec: securityContext: {} serviceAccount: <service_account> serviceAccountName: <service_account> Refs: ref1 ref2 ref3 Each service account is represented by the ServiceAccount resource and is associated with two additional secrets for access to the OpenShift API and the internal registry: $ oc describe serviceaccounts/default Name: default Namespace: pgouser1 Labels: <none> Annotations: <none> Image pull secrets: default-dockercfg-nrhwt Mountable secrets: default-token-vm8b5 default-dockercfg-nrhwt Tokens: default-token-p6rhz default-token-vm8b5 Events: <none> The service account can be created and deleted with a simple command: oc create sa myserviceaccount oc delete sa/myserviceaccount Every service account is also a member of two groups: system:serviceaccounts , which includes all service accounts in the cluster system:serviceaccounts:<project> , which includes all service accounts in the project","title":"Service Accounts"},{"location":"databases/#roles-assigned-to-service-accounts","text":"When you create a pod, if you do not specify a service account, it is automatically assigned the default service account in the same namespace.

OpenShift ships with several SCCs: The most constrained is the restricted SCC , and the least constrained is the privileged SCC : oc edit scc restricted oc edit scc privileged The other SCCs provide intermediate levels of constraint for various use cases. The restricted SCC is granted to all authenticated users by default. The default SCC for most pods should be the restricted SCC. If required, a cluster administrator may allow certain pods to run with different SCCs . Pods should be run with the most restrictive SCC possible.

Wikipedia: Software bot Tips \u00b6 Use bots to accomplish tasks like merging PR\u2019s that have been approved and automatically updating dependencies. Usage of one of these bots might allow us to trigger certain builds based off of specific GitHub tags, it would allow us to only selectively run certain test suites and increase the throughput of the build by only testing changes made in a branch / PR. Investigate options that are available and see if we can integrate them with CI. We should be able to configure this bot to automatically apply labels to PR\u2019s based off of what is changed in a PR. For instance, if a PR contains any documentation changes, the area/Documentation label can be applied.

Our group has a bot that creates merge requests for certain mechanical changes to our code base. We\u2019d like these MRs to get merged in automatically if/when the CI pipeline succeeds, but our projects require an approval from a member of our group. This means that right now a human has to manually click on \u201capprove\u201d and \u201cmerge\u201d for each bot-created MR. Apparently GitLab doesn\u2019t have a way to set different approval rules for some users, so I haven\u2019t found a way to make the bot\u2019s user immune to this requirement. My current idea is to have a separate process that approves each of the merge requests created by the bot. Is there an easy way to do this programmatically? That is, is there an API (or better yet, a command line tool) that, when given the name of the branch for a merge request, approves the merge request associated with that branch? I\u2019m also open to other ways of getting these changes in with minimal human intervention. I do want them to pass the CI pipeline, though (which is currently accomplished by having them use MRs) and the MRs also help in the rare cases where the pipeline fails, so we can debug what went wrong.

In this article I have used JDK8 Oracle Hot Spot 64 bit JVM. First let me depict the different memory areas available for Java processes. DZone: Memory Leaks and Java Code When you aren\u2019t using objects, but they aren\u2019t touched by GC, a memory leak happens. Here are six ways memory leaks happen to look for and avoid. Cambios importantes en la gesti\u00f3n de memoria de Java 8 de Oracle (2014) \u00b6 PermGen no pertenece al heap y los objetos no son promocionados a esta secci\u00f3n de memoria gestionada durante un GC. Como bien dices es un espacio contiguo al heap, pero tambi\u00e9n se limpia cada vez que la tenured/old generation procede a un GC. No es una generaci\u00f3n separada del mismo modo que es la young generation, y no hay un mecanismo espec\u00edfico para un GC separado de PermGen. La tenured/old generation y la permanent generation proceden a un GC cuando una de las dos se llena. De todos modos no me queda claro si incorporaron PermGen dentro del heap en Java 7, aunque poco importa ya con los cambios en Java 8. Mejor empiezo por introducir qu\u00e9 implementaci\u00f3n de JVM es Java 8 de Oracle. Existen numerosas implementaciones de JVM y cada una utiliza diferentes soluciones para la gesti\u00f3n de memoria. Dos de las soluciones m\u00e1s conocidas y populares de JVM han sido HotSpot de Sun (habitual en Tomcat) y JRockit de BEA (Weblogic). Ambas compa\u00f1ias fueron compradas por Oracle y Java 8 viene a ser la integraci\u00f3n definitiva de ambas soluciones. Hist\u00f3ricamente se consideraba que HotSpot es el JVM con mejor rendimiento de las dos, si bien JRockit es valorada como la m\u00e1s escalable. Originalmente en HotSpot no hab\u00eda generaci\u00f3n permanente. Objetos y clases de JVM se almacenaban juntas. Las clases de \u00e9sta JVM eran est\u00e1ticas y pr\u00e1cticamente no se utilizaban \u2018Class Loaders\u2019 (Load y Unload/Collection de Clases). PermGen surgi\u00f3 como una mejora de rendimiento. Por defecto los datos en la generaci\u00f3n permanente no se eliminan nunca (son datos de JVM y no de aplicaci\u00f3n, pudiendo variar seg\u00fan la p\u00f3l\u00edtica de garbage collection). Esto pod\u00eda llenar la generaci\u00f3n permanente generando un OutOfMemoryErrors si se produc\u00eda un elevado n\u00famero de classloading. En muchos casos un problema con una generaci\u00f3n permanente implica reiniciar regularmente la JVM y la aplicaci\u00f3n Java. Actualmente las clases de JVM son din\u00e1micas y el espacio requerido para metadatos puede cambiar f\u00e1cilmente. A diferencia de HotSpot VM, JRockit carece de generaci\u00f3n permanente y en cambio almacena los metadatos \u2018off the heap\u2019 en memoria nativa. Estos buffers de c\u00f3digo son liberados constantemente cuando sus ClassLoaders no se utilizan. El problema de OutOfMemory en JRockit no es diferente a HotSpot, excepto por el hecho de ser memoria nativa en lugar de memoria heap. Hay dos diferencias significativas. Primero, en JRockit la limpieza de metadatos est\u00e1 habilitada siempre por defecto y segundo, no hay tama\u00f1o l\u00edmite fijo para el espacio de metadatos. Uno de los principales problemas con HotSpot es su dificultad para seleccionar un tama\u00f1o adecuado para la generaci\u00f3n permanente. \u00bf128MB, 256MB? Es muy dif\u00edcil acertar para cada aplicaci\u00f3n. JRockit es din\u00e1mico en la gesti\u00f3n de memoria reservada para metadatos y sin l\u00edmites de tama\u00f1o (a excepci\u00f3n de la memoria del sistema). JRockit es tambi\u00e9n el \u00fanico JVM con soporte de heaps no contiguos (uso de memoria por encima y por debajo del alojamiento del kernel y otras librer\u00edas), importante en el caso de Windows donde su kernel a menudo se ubica en mitad del espacio de direcciones. Java 8 (HotRockit?) incorpora todas las herramientas de monitorizaci\u00f3n de HotSpot (Java VisualVM, jstat, jmap) y JRockit (Java Mission Control, Java Flight Recorder). Muy interesante. Un inconveniente de Java 8 es la fragmentaci\u00f3n de la memoria nativa para metadatos, pero probablemente incluya compactaci\u00f3n en un futuro pr\u00f3ximo. En el 2016 saldr\u00e1 Java 9 con la funcionalidad de auto-tuning y soporte de tama\u00f1os Heap multi-gigas. En cualquier caso hay una tendencia al Heap-Offloading. El consumo de memoria en Java tiene un coste y las pausas/latencias causadas por los Full GC son proporcionales al tama\u00f1o del heap. Estas pausas son notables en tama\u00f1os de heap > 1Gb, con un considerable impacto en aplicaciones de tiempo real donde un proceso que no responde r\u00e1pido puede ser descartado del cluster. A\u00fan as\u00ed, los servidores actuales hacen uso de frameworks muy pesados y f\u00e1cilmente requieren heaps > 4Gb. Una soluci\u00f3n a este problema es alojar fuera del heap los objetos poco utilizados mediante t\u00e9cnicas de serializaci\u00f3n/deserializaci\u00f3n (cach\u00e9). El heap de memoria se mantiene peque\u00f1o y el Full GC se completa en milisegundos. Ejemplos: cach\u00e9 de sesi\u00f3n de usuarios, donde un fichero mapeado en memoria almacena gigabytes de sesiones de usuarios inactivos.

Jenkins Online Meetup Andreas Grabner from Dynatrace will talk about automating Service Level Indicators/Service Level Objectives based build validation with Keptn and Jenkins. In many organizations up to 80% of pipeline execution time is spent in manual build validation steps. How can we reduce that? One option is applying Google\u2019s SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) practices by automating SLI (Service Level Indicators) & SLO (Service Level Objectives) based build validation . This method has proven to detect problematic issues in production and also allows us to automatically approve or reject builds being pushed through our pipelines. In this session you learn the basics of picking good SLIs & SLOs and how to extract them from your monitoring tools. After this session you will be able to start implementing this integration yourself with Jenkins. To give you a jump start you will be introduced to the open source project Keptn which provides automated SLI/SLO-based quality gates .

In order to simplify plugin development, the Jenkins project offers a standard Parent POM which defines the recommended build, verification and release flow. Such parent POM helps us to ensure quality of the Jenkins plugins. In April 2020 we released a new major release of the parent POM which includes a number of important and sometimes incompatible changes: Jenkins core Bill of materials, full migration to SpotBugs, etc. In this presentation James Nord will talk about the changes introduced in Plugin POM 4.0.

The new offering strengthens CloudBees\u2019 leadership in the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) space by extending users\u2019 ability to leverage feature flag technology in both on-premise and cloud environments. CloudBees Feature Flags is from the company and application formerly known as Rollout, acquired last year by CloudBees . Feature flags have emerged as popular tools for deploying new features with the added advantage of enabling risk-free experimentation and fast results. As organizations enhance applications with rich new capabilities, many use feature flags to preview features for select audiences, with the ability to pull them back quickly if the functionality is not successful. In a recent survey , 97% of respondents say that it is important for their organization to implement new application features quickly, yet 65% say it is difficult for their organization to do so safely. CloudBees Feature Flags enables developers to easily release new features with confidence, reduce risk in doing so and manage large numbers of feature flags at scale. \u201cVery soon, all features will be released behind a feature flag. It\u2019s a natural evolution in continuous delivery. CloudBees has led the way in feature flag technology, making it a core part of our overall offering,\u201d said Sacha Labourey, CEO and co-founder, CloudBees. \u201cWith this release, we are providing the same functionality for on-premise environments that previously had only been available as a cloud-based service. We are committed to the ongoing integration, automation and governance of feature flags within the software delivery lifecycle and giving users choice in selecting the best environment for their project \u2013 on-premise or cloud.\u201d CloudBees Feature Flags integrates with the company\u2019s deep CI/CD capabilities, giving organizations the most comprehensive feature management capabilities in the software development life cycle (SDLC). The ability to use feature flagging in an on-premise environment also opens up new avenues for usage in industries, such as government, finance, pharmaceuticals, utilities and healthcare, where there can be a mix of on-premise and cloud environments. \u201cWe recognize that many companies are realizing the benefits of feature flags,\u201d said Moritz Plassnig, senior vice president and general manager, Software Delivery Management and Software Delivery Automation Cloud at CloudBees. \u201cBy flagging features, they no longer have to sacrifice innovation to lower risk. We felt that it was critical to offer this technology to any company working in on-premise or hybrid environments.\u201d CloudBees Accelerator \u00b6 CloudBees Accelerator Shorten Build and Test Times How to Speed Up Software Development with Build and Test Acceleration Tools Jervis: Jenkins as a service \u00b6 Jervis is Sam Gleske \u2018s vision of a good way to roll out Jenkins as a service in very large organizations. SCM Filter Jervis YAML Plugin This plugin is intended for Jenkins infrastructure relying on jervis to deliver software in a self-service manner. This plugin can also be used for Travis CI YAML. Jenkins X \u00b6 Jenkins X is a specialized Jenkins for Kubernetes: This is how it works from a bird eye the CI/CD: a developer creates a branch, then Jenkins X creates a ephemeral namespace with that branch. The developer tests it and once it is ok, a PR is created, then, the branch is deployed in staging. When I merge it, it goes to QA, and with a manual command \u201cjx promote\u201d it goes to production. Jenkins X deletes automatically after N hours the branch namespace. jenkins-x.io itnext.io/tagged/jenkins-x itnext.io: Jenkins X \u2014 Managing Jenkins Video Tutorials: Youtube: Jenkins X: Continuous Delivery for Kubernetes with James Strachan Youtube: Kubernetes Package Management with Helm and CI/CD with Jenkins X - Webinar by Neependra Khare go.digitalocean.com/cicd-on-k8s","title":"Jenkins & Cloudbees"},{"location":"jenkins/#jenkins-cloudbees","text":"Jenkins Groovy Awesome Jenkins Jenkins Cheat Sheet Online Learning Jenkins Configuration as Code Solutions. 3 available DSLs DSL 1.

One option is applying Google\u2019s SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) practices by automating SLI (Service Level Indicators) & SLO (Service Level Objectives) based build validation . This method has proven to detect problematic issues in production and also allows us to automatically approve or reject builds being pushed through our pipelines. In this session you learn the basics of picking good SLIs & SLOs and how to extract them from your monitoring tools. After this session you will be able to start implementing this integration yourself with Jenkins. To give you a jump start you will be introduced to the open source project Keptn which provides automated SLI/SLO-based quality gates . Then we\u2019ll talk about Keptn Jenkins Shared Library which integrates Jenkins and Keptn with just a couple of function calls. youtube: Level-Up your Jenkins-based Delivery with Keptn","title":"Automating Service Level Indicators/Service Level Objectives based build validation with Keptn and Jenkins"},{"location":"jenkins/#dsl-3-jenkins-configuration-as-code-jcasc","text":"Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin devops.com: Using jenkins configuration as code opensource.com: Getting started with Jenkins Configuration as Code \ud83c\udf1f JCasC uses YAML formats to set up Jenkins configurations. dzone.com: Jenkins Configuration as Code: Need for Speed! \ud83c\udf1f https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin Dzone: Running Jenkins Server With Configuration-as-Code \ud83c\udf1f Take a look at the new plugin for Jenkins that allows you to to create pipelines using YAML!

The new offering strengthens CloudBees\u2019 leadership in the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) space by extending users\u2019 ability to leverage feature flag technology in both on-premise and cloud environments. CloudBees Feature Flags is from the company and application formerly known as Rollout, acquired last year by CloudBees . Feature flags have emerged as popular tools for deploying new features with the added advantage of enabling risk-free experimentation and fast results. As organizations enhance applications with rich new capabilities, many use feature flags to preview features for select audiences, with the ability to pull them back quickly if the functionality is not successful. In a recent survey , 97% of respondents say that it is important for their organization to implement new application features quickly, yet 65% say it is difficult for their organization to do so safely. CloudBees Feature Flags enables developers to easily release new features with confidence, reduce risk in doing so and manage large numbers of feature flags at scale. \u201cVery soon, all features will be released behind a feature flag. It\u2019s a natural evolution in continuous delivery. CloudBees has led the way in feature flag technology, making it a core part of our overall offering,\u201d said Sacha Labourey, CEO and co-founder, CloudBees. \u201cWith this release, we are providing the same functionality for on-premise environments that previously had only been available as a cloud-based service. We are committed to the ongoing integration, automation and governance of feature flags within the software delivery lifecycle and giving users choice in selecting the best environment for their project \u2013 on-premise or cloud.\u201d CloudBees Feature Flags integrates with the company\u2019s deep CI/CD capabilities, giving organizations the most comprehensive feature management capabilities in the software development life cycle (SDLC). The ability to use feature flagging in an on-premise environment also opens up new avenues for usage in industries, such as government, finance, pharmaceuticals, utilities and healthcare, where there can be a mix of on-premise and cloud environments. \u201cWe recognize that many companies are realizing the benefits of feature flags,\u201d said Moritz Plassnig, senior vice president and general manager, Software Delivery Management and Software Delivery Automation Cloud at CloudBees. \u201cBy flagging features, they no longer have to sacrifice innovation to lower risk. We felt that it was critical to offer this technology to any company working in on-premise or hybrid environments.\u201d","title":"Feature Flags in CloudBees Enterprise On-Premise"},{"location":"jenkins/#cloudbees-accelerator","text":"CloudBees Accelerator Shorten Build and Test Times How to Speed Up Software Development with Build and Test Acceleration Tools","title":"CloudBees Accelerator"},{"location":"jenkins/#jervis-jenkins-as-a-service","text":"Jervis is Sam Gleske \u2018s vision of a good way to roll out Jenkins as a service in very large organizations.

Extending Kubernetes API with Kubernetes Resource Definitions. CRD vs Aggregated API \u00b6 Custom Resources Use a custom resource (CRD or Aggregated API) if most of the following apply: You want to use Kubernetes client libraries and CLIs to create and update the new resource. You want top-level support from kubectl; for example, kubectl get my-object object-name. You want to build new automation that watches for updates on the new object, and then CRUD other objects, or vice versa. You want to write automation that handles updates to the object. You want to use Kubernetes API conventions like .spec, .status, and .metadata. You want the object to be an abstraction over a collection of controlled resources, or a summarization of other resources. Kubernetes provides two ways to add custom resources to your cluster: CRDs are simple and can be created without any programming. API Aggregation requires programming, but allows more control over API behaviors like how data is stored and conversion between API versions. Kubernetes provides these two options to meet the needs of different users, so that neither ease of use nor flexibility is compromised. Aggregated APIs are subordinate API servers that sit behind the primary API server, which acts as a proxy. This arrangement is called API Aggregation (AA). To users, it simply appears that the Kubernetes API is extended. CRDs allow users to create new types of resources without adding another API server. You do not need to understand API Aggregation to use CRDs. Regardless of how they are installed, the new resources are referred to as Custom Resources to distinguish them from built-in Kubernetes resources (like pods).

Rancher: Enterprise management for Kubernetes \u00b6 rancher.com Rancher is enterprise management for Kubernetes, an amazing GUI for managing and installing Kubernetes clusters. They have released a number of pieces of software that are part of this ecosystem, for example Longhorn which is a lightweight and reliable distributed block storage system for Kubernetes. rancher.com: Custom alerts using Prometheus queries zdnet.com: Rancher Labs closes $40M funding round to \u201crun Kubernetes everywhere\u201d The six year-old startup is going after new markets that want to run Kubernetes clusters at the edge. Rancher 2 \u00b6 Rancher 2 Rancher 2 RKE \u00b6 Rancher 2 RKE Rancher 2 that runs in docker containers. RKE is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It solves the common frustration of installation complexity with Kubernetes by removing most host dependencies and presenting a stable path for deployment, upgrades, and rollbacks. Rancher.com: Setup a basic Kubernetes cluster with ease using RKE K3S \u00b6 k3s Basic kubernetes with automated installer. Lightweight Kubernetes Distribution. K8s vs k3s \u201cK3s is designed to be a single binary of less than 40MB that completely implements the Kubernetes API. In order to achieve this, they removed a lot of extra drivers that didn\u2019t need to be part of the core and are easily replaced with add-ons. K3s is a fully CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) certified Kubernetes offering. This means that you can write your YAML to operate against a regular \u201cfull-fat\u201d Kubernetes and they\u2019ll also apply against a k3s cluster. Due to its low resource requirements, it\u2019s possible to run a cluster on anything from 512MB of RAM machines upwards. This means that we can allow pods to run on the master, as well as nodes. And of course, because it\u2019s a tiny binary, it means we can install it in a fraction of the time it takes to launch a regular Kubernetes cluster! We generally achieve sub-two minutes to launch a k3s cluster with a handful of nodes, meaning you can be deploying apps to learn/test at the drop of a hat.\u201d k3sup (said \u2018ketchup\u2019) is a light-weight utility to get from zero to KUBECONFIG with k3s on any local or remote VM. All you need is ssh access and the k3sup binary to get kubectl access immediately. Install Kubernetes with k3sup and k3s K3S Use Cases \u00b6 K3S Use Cases : Edge computing and Embedded Systems IOT Gateway CI environments (i.e. Jenkins with Configuration as Code) Single-App Clusters K3S in Public Clouds \u00b6 Run Rancher 2.4 in Azure with K3s and MySQL K3D \u00b6 k3d k3s that runs in docker containers. K3OS \u00b6 k3OS k3OS is a Linux distribution designed to remove as much OS maintenance as possible in a Kubernetes cluster. It is specifically designed to only have what is needed to run k3s. Additionally the OS is designed to be managed by kubectl once a cluster is bootstrapped. Nodes only need to join a cluster and then all aspects of the OS can be managed from Kubernetes. Both k3OS and k3s upgrades are handled by the k3OS operator. K3OS Value Add : Supports multiple architectures K3OS runs on x86 and ARM processors to give you maximum flexibility. Runs only the minimum required services Fewer services means a tiny attack surface, for greater security. Doesn\u2019t require a package manager The required services are built into the distribution image. Models infrastructure as code Manage system configuration with version control systems. K3C \u00b6 K3C Lightweight local container engine for container development. K3C is a local container engine designed to fill the same gap Docker does in the Kubernetes ecosystem. Specifically k3c focuses on developing and running local containers, basically docker run/build. Currently k3s, the lightweight Kubernetes distribution , provides a great solution for Kubernetes from dev to production. While k3s satisifies the Kubernetes runtime needs, one still needs to run docker (or a docker-like tool) to actually develop and build the container images. k3c is intended to replace docker for just the functionality needed for the Kubernetes ecosystem.

Building new applications requires writing a good amount of boilerplate config, copying code from other projects, and applying manual tweaks and customizations. As applications evolve and teams grow, these YAML files become harder to manage. Sharing best practices or making updates involves manual changes and complex migrations. YAML is an excellent format for describing the desired state of your cluster, but it is does not have primitives for expressing logic and reusable abstractions. There are multiple tools in the Kubernetes ecosystem which attempt to address these gaps in various ways: kustomize Customization of kubernetes YAML configurations jsonnet data templating language jsonnet.org jkcfg Configuration as Code with ECMAScript jkcfg.github.io kubecfg A tool for managing complex enterprise Kubernetes environments as code. kubegen Simple way to describe Kubernetes resources in a structured way, but without new syntax or magic Pulumi We realized this was exactly the same problem our customers had faced when defining their applications through CloudFormation templates, a problem solved by the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) , and that we could apply the same design concepts from the AWS CDK to help all Kubernetes users.

You want top-level support from kubectl; for example, kubectl get my-object object-name. You want to build new automation that watches for updates on the new object, and then CRUD other objects, or vice versa. You want to write automation that handles updates to the object. You want to use Kubernetes API conventions like .spec, .status, and .metadata. You want the object to be an abstraction over a collection of controlled resources, or a summarization of other resources. Kubernetes provides two ways to add custom resources to your cluster: CRDs are simple and can be created without any programming. API Aggregation requires programming, but allows more control over API behaviors like how data is stored and conversion between API versions. Kubernetes provides these two options to meet the needs of different users, so that neither ease of use nor flexibility is compromised. Aggregated APIs are subordinate API servers that sit behind the primary API server, which acts as a proxy. This arrangement is called API Aggregation (AA). To users, it simply appears that the Kubernetes API is extended. CRDs allow users to create new types of resources without adding another API server. You do not need to understand API Aggregation to use CRDs. Regardless of how they are installed, the new resources are referred to as Custom Resources to distinguish them from built-in Kubernetes resources (like pods).","title":"Adding Custom Resources.

This repository contains scaffolding and automation for developing a custom dashboarding strategy on OpenShift using the OpenShift Monitoring stac Capacity Management Grafana Dashboard \u00b6 This repo adds a capacity management Grafana dashboard. The intent of this dashboard is to answer a single question: Do I need a new node? . We believe this is the most important question when setting up a capacity management process. We are aware that this is not the only question a capacity management process may need to be able to answer. Thus, this should be considered as the starting point for organizations to build their capacity management process.

La arquitectura de Prometheus se basa en \u201cpull metrics\u201d (extracci\u00f3n de m\u00e9tricas) . En lugar de empujar las m\u00e9tricas (\u201cpushing metrics\u201d) hacia la herramienta de monitorizaci\u00f3n, extrae (\u201cpull\u201d) las m\u00e9tricas de los servicios (por defecto un \u201c/metrics\u201d HTTP endpoint) en texto plano (parseable por humanos y de f\u00e1cil diagn\u00f3stico). Prometheus tambi\u00e9n tiene un \u201cpush gateway\u201d, de modo que tambi\u00e9n soporta \u201cpush\u201d para m\u00e9tricas espec\u00edficas cuando el modelo de \u201cpull\u201d no funciona (si bien este m\u00e9todo no es recomendable). Prometheus se puede conectar a series de tiempo (time series) con un nombre de m\u00e9trica y pares clave-valor, simplificando la monitorizaci\u00f3n en complejos entornos cloud multi-nodo. La herramienta tambi\u00e9n proporciona PromQL , para el procesado de datos \u201ctime-series\u201d. Permite realizar consultas (queries) para la manipulaci\u00f3n de datos y generar nueva informaci\u00f3n relevante. Con PromQL se pueden generar gr\u00e1ficos, visualizar conjuntos de datos, crear tablas, y generar alertas basadas en par\u00e1metros espec\u00edficos. La consola web de Prometheus permite gestionar todas las caracter\u00edsticas y herramientas disponibles en Prometheus. Se pueden utilizar expresiones regulares y consultas avanzadas de PromQL para la creaci\u00f3n de conjuntos de datos (datasets) y alertas. Prometheus activamente \u201cscrapea\u201d datos, los almacena, y soporta \u201cqueries\u201d, \u201cgr\u00e1ficos\u201d y \u201calertas\u201d, as\u00ed como proporciona \u201cendpoints\u201d a otros consumidores API como Grafana. Todo esto lo realiza con los siguientes componentes: Librer\u00edas cliente : instrumentaci\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo de aplicaci\u00f3n (para generar eventos). Servidor Prometheus : \u201cscrapeando\u201d y almacenando estos eventos, cuando se generan, como \u201ctime series data\u201d. Este es el modelo \u201cpull\u201d m\u00e1s com\u00fan para la recogida general de m\u00e9tricas en Prometheus. Pushgateway : Modelo \u201cPush\u201d , soportando trabajos ef\u00edmeros de importaci\u00f3n de datos. S\u00f3lo recomendable en aplicaciones \u201cserverless\u201d , donde las aplicaciones son lanzadas y destruidas bajo demanda, as\u00ed como las aplicaciones que manejan \u201cbatch jobs\u201d. Exportadores de Datos : exportando servicios como HAProxy, StatsD, Graphite, etc. Prometheus se diferencia de otros sistemas de monitorizaci\u00f3n con las siguientes funcionalidades: Modelo de datos multi-dimensional, donde los \u201ctime-series data\u201d se definen por el nombre de la m\u00e9trica y dimensiones clave/valor. Nodos \u00fanicos de servidor y aut\u00f3nomos, sin dependencia de almacenamiento distribuido. Recogida de datos via un modelo \u201cpull\u201d sobre HTTP. \u201cTime Series Data\u201d empujado (\u201cpushed\u201d) a otros destinos de datos v\u00eda un gateway intermediario. \u201cTargets\u201d descubiertos via \u201cservice discovery\u201d \u00f3 configuraci\u00f3n est\u00e1tica. Soporte de federaci\u00f3n horizontal y vertical. magalix.com: Monitoring of Kubernetes Clusters To Manage Large Scale Projects Prometheus Storage \u00b6 Proporciona etiquetado clave-valor y \u201ctime-series\u201d. La propia documentaci\u00f3n de Prometheus explica c\u00f3mo se gestiona el almacenamiento en disco ( Prometheus Time-Series DB ). La ingesti\u00f3n de datos se agrupa en bloques de dos horas, donde cada bloque es un directorio conteniendo uno o m\u00e1s \u201cchunk files\u201d (los datos), adem\u00e1s de un fichero de metadatos y un fichero index: Almacenamiento de datos en disco (Prometheus Time-Series DB): ./data/01BKGV7JBM69T2G1BGBGM6KB12 ./data/01BKGV7JBM69T2G1BGBGM6KB12/meta.json ./data/01BKGV7JBM69T2G1BGBGM6KB12/wal ./data/01BKGV7JBM69T2G1BGBGM6KB12/wal/000002 ./data/01BKGV7JBM69T2G1BGBGM6KB12/wal/000001 Un proceso en segundo plano compacta los bloques de dos horas en otros m\u00e1s grandes. Es posible almacenar los datos en otras soluciones de \u201cTime-Series Database\u201d como InfluxDB . Scalability, High Availability (HA) and Long-Term Storage \u00b6 Prometheus fue dise\u00f1ado para ser f\u00e1cil de desplegar. Es extremadamente f\u00e1cil ponerlo en marcha, recoger algunas m\u00e9tricas, y empezar a construir nuestra propia herramienta de monitorizaci\u00f3n. Las cosas se complican cuando se intenta operar a un nivel de escalado considerable. Para entender si esto va a ser un problema, conviene plantearse las siguiente preguntas: \u00bfCu\u00e1ntas m\u00e9tricas puede ingerir el sistema de monitorizaci\u00f3n y cu\u00e1ntas son necesarias? \u00bfCu\u00e1l es la cardinalidad de las m\u00e9tricas? La cardinalidad es el n\u00famero de etiquetas que cada m\u00e9trica puede tener. Es una cuesti\u00f3n muy frecuente en las m\u00e9tricas pertenecientes a entornos din\u00e1micos donde a los contenedores se les asignan un ID \u00f3 nombre diferente cada vez que son lanzados, reiniciados o movidos entre nodos (caso de kubernetes). \u00bfEs necesaria la Alta Disponibilidad (HA)? \u00bfDurante cu\u00e1nto tiempo es necesario mantener las m\u00e9tricas y con qu\u00e9 resoluci\u00f3n? La implementaci\u00f3n de HA es laboriosa porque la funcionalidad de cluster requiere a\u00f1adir plugins de terceros al servidor Prometheus. Es necesario tratar con \u201cbackups\u201d y \u201crestores\u201d, y el almacenamiento de m\u00e9tricas por un periodo de tiempo extendido har\u00e1 que la base de datos crezca exponencialmente. Los servidores Prometheus proporcionan almacenamiento persistente, pero Prometheus no fue creado para el almacenamiento distribuido de m\u00e9tricas a lo largo de m\u00faltiples nodos de un cluster con replicaci\u00f3n y capacidad curativa (como es el caso de Kubernetes). Esto es conocido como \u201calmacenamiento a largo-plazo\u201d (Long-Term) y actualmente es un requisito en unos pocos casos de uso, por ejemplo en la planificaci\u00f3n de la capacidad para monitorizar c\u00f3mo la infraestructura necesita evolucionar, contracargos para facturar diferentes equipos \u00f3 departamentos para un caso espec\u00edfico que han hecho de la infraestructura, an\u00e1lisis de tendencias de uso, o adherirse a regulaciones para verticales espec\u00edficos como banca, seguros, etc. Storage Solutions for Prometheus \u00b6 Prometheus TSDB Cortex : Provides horizontally scalable, highly available, multi-tenant, long term storage for Prometheus. Cortex allows for storing time series data in a key-value store like Cassandra, AWS DynamoDB, or Google BigTable. It offers a Prometheus compatible query API, and you can push metrics into a write endpoint. This makes it best suited for cloud environments and multi-tenant scenarios like service providers building hosted and managed platforms. Weave Cortex SaaS (Hosted Prometheus - Public Cloud) Thanos : Open source, highly available Prometheus setup with long term storage capabilities . Thanos stores time series data in an object store like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, etc. Thanos pushes metrics through a side-car container from each Prometheus server through the gRPC store API to the query service in order to provide a global query view. github.com/ruanbekker: Thanos Cluster Setup How to deploy a HA Prometheus setup with Unlimited Data Retention Capabilities on aws cloud S3 with Thanos Metrics. Highly Available Prometheus Metrics for Distributed SQL with Thanos on GKE InfluxDB : An open-source time series database (TSDB) developed by InfluxData.

M3 : An open source, large-scale metrics platform developed by Uber. It has its own time series database, M3DB. Like Thanos, M3 also uses a side-car container to push the metrics to the DB. In addition, it supports metric deduplication and merging, and provides distributed query support. Although it\u2019s exciting to see attempts to address the challenges of running Prometheus at scale, these are very young projects that are not widely used yet. Collectors. Software exposing Prometheus metrics \u00b6 Prometheus Exporters. Plug-in architecture and extensibility with Prometheus Exporters (collectors) \u00b6 Prometheus proporciona un ecosistema de \u201cexporters\u201d , los cuales permiten que herramientas de terceros puedan exportar sus datos en Prometheus. Muchos componentes de software de c\u00f3digo abierto son compatibles por defecto. Un \u201cexporter\u201d expone las m\u00e9tricas de uno \u00f3 varios \u201ccollectors\u201d.

Red Hat AMQ Broker is based on ActiveMQ Artemis, being this the reason why one of the following proof of concepts is done with Artemis (the other one was run in order to learn telegraf, prometheus and grafana). The same solution tested with Artemis on RHEL is valid for Red Hat AMQ 7 Broker on RHEL. Red Hat AMQ 7 Broker is OpenShift 3.11 compliant as Technical Preview and deployed as Operator. Red Hat AMQ 7 Operator is fully supported in OpenShift 4.x, initially with Prometheus and Grafana monitoring already setup and maintained by AMQ Operator. It is recommended to check the metrics collected and displayed by AMQ Operator with another Proof of Concept in OpenShift 4.x.

OpenTelemetry.io \u00b6 Used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems. OpenTelemetry.io : Unified standard (open, vendor-neutral API), merge of OpenCensus.io and OpenTracing.io . \u201cA single set of system components and language-specific telemetry libraries\u201d to standardize how the industry uses metrics, traces, and eventually logs to enable observability. A major component of the OpenTelemetry specification is distributed tracing . Tracing is about analyzing, recording, and describing transactions. Distributed Tracing: Troubleshooting requests between interconnected cloud-based microservices can\u2019t always be done with logs and metrics alone. This is where distributed tracing comes into play: It provides developers with a detailed view of individual requests as they \u201chop\u201d through a system of microservices. With distributed tracing you can: Trace the path of a request as it travels across a complex system. Discover the latency of the components along that path. Know which component in the path is creating a bottleneck or failure. Performance: Latency is a very important metric in microservices. Latency problems in one service will impact the overall request latency when chaining calls to different microservices. Every call to a microservice should record a trace, which is basically a record of how much time it took to respond. It\u2019s possible to add more details to the function level, including the action, the result, and the pass to the next service. The hard part is triaging all traces in a request from a client. Usually, a trace ID header has to be sent in every request. If there isn\u2019t one, the logging library creates it and it will represent the first trace in a request. Adding traces with OpenCensus is simply a matter of including the libraries and registering an exporter. Monitoring in a Microservices/Kubernetes World: In distributed system architectures like microservices, having visibility from different perspectives will be critical at troubleshooting time. Many things could happen in a request when there are many parts constantly interacting at the same time. The most common method is to write logs to the stdout and stderr streams. For example, a latency problem in the system could exist because a microservice is not responding correctly. Maybe Kubernetes is restarting the pod too frequently, or perhaps the cluster is out of capacity and can\u2019t schedule any more pods. But for this reason, tools like Istio exist; by injecting a container in every pod, you can get a pretty good baseline of telemetry. Additionally, when you add instrumentation with libraries like OpenCensus , you can deeply understand what\u2019s happening with and within each service. All this information will need a storage location, and as a good practice, you might want to have it a centralized location to provide access to anyone in the team \u2014 not just for the operations team.

Prometheus is software built for monitoring large, scalable systems and storing historical runtime data over an extended time period. The AMQ Broker Prometheus plugin exports the broker runtime metrics to Prometheus format , enabling you to use Prometheus itself to visualize and run queries on the data. You can also use a graphical tool, such as Grafana, to configure more advanced visualizations and dashboards for the metrics that the Prometheus plugin collects. The metrics that the plugin exports to Prometheus format are listed below. A description of each metric is exported along with the metric itself. ref1 , ref2 , ref3 Red Hat AMQ Streams (Kafka) JMX , OpenTracing+Jaeger ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, Kafka Connect, and the Kafka clients all expose management information using Java Management Extensions (JMX) . Most management information is in the form of metrics that are useful for monitoring the condition and performance of your Kafka cluster. Like other Java applications, Kafka provides this management information through managed beans or MBeans. JMX works at the level of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). To obtain management information, external tools can connect to the JVM that is running ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, and so on. By default, only tools on the same machine and running as the same user as the JVM are able to connect. Distributed Tracing with Jaeger: - Kafka Producers, Kafka Consumers, and Kafka Streams applications (referred to as Kafka clients) - MirrorMaker and Kafka Connect - Kafka Bridge ref1 , ref2 Red Hat AMQ Streams Operator AMQ Streams Operator (Prometheus & Jaeger), strimzi, jmxtrans How to monitor AMQ Streams Kafka, Zookeeper and Kafka Connect clusters using Prometheus to provide monitoring data for example Grafana dashboards. Support for distributed tracing in AMQ Streams, using Jaeger : - You instrument Kafka Producer, Consumer, and Streams API applications for distributed tracing using an OpenTracing client library. This involves adding instrumentation code to these clients, which monitors the execution of individual transactions in order to generate trace data. - Distributed tracing support is built in to the Kafka Connect, MirrorMaker, and Kafka Bridge components of AMQ Streams. To configure these components for distributed tracing, you configure and update the relevant custom resources. ref1 , ref2 , ref3 strimzi , ref4: jmxtrans , ref5: banzai operator Red Hat AMQ Broker Operator Prometheus (recommended) or Jolokia REST to JMX To monitor runtime data for brokers in your deployment, use one of these approaches: - Section 9.1, \u201cMonitoring broker runtime data using Prometheus\u201d - Section 9.2, \u201cMonitoring broker runtime data using JMX\u201d In general, using Prometheus is the recommended approach. However, you might choose to use the Jolokia REST interface to JMX if a metric that you need to monitor is not exported by the Prometheus plugin.

La arquitectura de Prometheus se basa en \u201cpull metrics\u201d (extracci\u00f3n de m\u00e9tricas) . En lugar de empujar las m\u00e9tricas (\u201cpushing metrics\u201d) hacia la herramienta de monitorizaci\u00f3n, extrae (\u201cpull\u201d) las m\u00e9tricas de los servicios (por defecto un \u201c/metrics\u201d HTTP endpoint) en texto plano (parseable por humanos y de f\u00e1cil diagn\u00f3stico). Prometheus tambi\u00e9n tiene un \u201cpush gateway\u201d, de modo que tambi\u00e9n soporta \u201cpush\u201d para m\u00e9tricas espec\u00edficas cuando el modelo de \u201cpull\u201d no funciona (si bien este m\u00e9todo no es recomendable). Prometheus se puede conectar a series de tiempo (time series) con un nombre de m\u00e9trica y pares clave-valor, simplificando la monitorizaci\u00f3n en complejos entornos cloud multi-nodo. La herramienta tambi\u00e9n proporciona PromQL , para el procesado de datos \u201ctime-series\u201d. Permite realizar consultas (queries) para la manipulaci\u00f3n de datos y generar nueva informaci\u00f3n relevante. Con PromQL se pueden generar gr\u00e1ficos, visualizar conjuntos de datos, crear tablas, y generar alertas basadas en par\u00e1metros espec\u00edficos. La consola web de Prometheus permite gestionar todas las caracter\u00edsticas y herramientas disponibles en Prometheus. Se pueden utilizar expresiones regulares y consultas avanzadas de PromQL para la creaci\u00f3n de conjuntos de datos (datasets) y alertas. Prometheus activamente \u201cscrapea\u201d datos, los almacena, y soporta \u201cqueries\u201d, \u201cgr\u00e1ficos\u201d y \u201calertas\u201d, as\u00ed como proporciona \u201cendpoints\u201d a otros consumidores API como Grafana. Todo esto lo realiza con los siguientes componentes: Librer\u00edas cliente : instrumentaci\u00f3n del c\u00f3digo de aplicaci\u00f3n (para generar eventos). Servidor Prometheus : \u201cscrapeando\u201d y almacenando estos eventos, cuando se generan, como \u201ctime series data\u201d. Este es el modelo \u201cpull\u201d m\u00e1s com\u00fan para la recogida general de m\u00e9tricas en Prometheus. Pushgateway : Modelo \u201cPush\u201d , soportando trabajos ef\u00edmeros de importaci\u00f3n de datos. S\u00f3lo recomendable en aplicaciones \u201cserverless\u201d , donde las aplicaciones son lanzadas y destruidas bajo demanda, as\u00ed como las aplicaciones que manejan \u201cbatch jobs\u201d. Exportadores de Datos : exportando servicios como HAProxy, StatsD, Graphite, etc. Prometheus se diferencia de otros sistemas de monitorizaci\u00f3n con las siguientes funcionalidades: Modelo de datos multi-dimensional, donde los \u201ctime-series data\u201d se definen por el nombre de la m\u00e9trica y dimensiones clave/valor. Nodos \u00fanicos de servidor y aut\u00f3nomos, sin dependencia de almacenamiento distribuido.

Las cosas se complican cuando se intenta operar a un nivel de escalado considerable. Para entender si esto va a ser un problema, conviene plantearse las siguiente preguntas: \u00bfCu\u00e1ntas m\u00e9tricas puede ingerir el sistema de monitorizaci\u00f3n y cu\u00e1ntas son necesarias? \u00bfCu\u00e1l es la cardinalidad de las m\u00e9tricas? La cardinalidad es el n\u00famero de etiquetas que cada m\u00e9trica puede tener.

OpenTelemetry.io : Unified standard (open, vendor-neutral API), merge of OpenCensus.io and OpenTracing.io . \u201cA single set of system components and language-specific telemetry libraries\u201d to standardize how the industry uses metrics, traces, and eventually logs to enable observability. A major component of the OpenTelemetry specification is distributed tracing . Tracing is about analyzing, recording, and describing transactions. Distributed Tracing: Troubleshooting requests between interconnected cloud-based microservices can\u2019t always be done with logs and metrics alone. This is where distributed tracing comes into play: It provides developers with a detailed view of individual requests as they \u201chop\u201d through a system of microservices. With distributed tracing you can: Trace the path of a request as it travels across a complex system. Discover the latency of the components along that path. Know which component in the path is creating a bottleneck or failure. Performance: Latency is a very important metric in microservices. Latency problems in one service will impact the overall request latency when chaining calls to different microservices. Every call to a microservice should record a trace, which is basically a record of how much time it took to respond. It\u2019s possible to add more details to the function level, including the action, the result, and the pass to the next service. The hard part is triaging all traces in a request from a client. Usually, a trace ID header has to be sent in every request. If there isn\u2019t one, the logging library creates it and it will represent the first trace in a request. Adding traces with OpenCensus is simply a matter of including the libraries and registering an exporter. Monitoring in a Microservices/Kubernetes World: In distributed system architectures like microservices, having visibility from different perspectives will be critical at troubleshooting time. Many things could happen in a request when there are many parts constantly interacting at the same time. The most common method is to write logs to the stdout and stderr streams. For example, a latency problem in the system could exist because a microservice is not responding correctly. Maybe Kubernetes is restarting the pod too frequently, or perhaps the cluster is out of capacity and can\u2019t schedule any more pods. But for this reason, tools like Istio exist; by injecting a container in every pod, you can get a pretty good baseline of telemetry. Additionally, when you add instrumentation with libraries like OpenCensus , you can deeply understand what\u2019s happening with and within each service. All this information will need a storage location, and as a good practice, you might want to have it a centralized location to provide access to anyone in the team \u2014 not just for the operations team.

Prometheus is software built for monitoring large, scalable systems and storing historical runtime data over an extended time period. The AMQ Broker Prometheus plugin exports the broker runtime metrics to Prometheus format , enabling you to use Prometheus itself to visualize and run queries on the data. You can also use a graphical tool, such as Grafana, to configure more advanced visualizations and dashboards for the metrics that the Prometheus plugin collects. The metrics that the plugin exports to Prometheus format are listed below. A description of each metric is exported along with the metric itself. ref1 , ref2 , ref3 Red Hat AMQ Streams (Kafka) JMX , OpenTracing+Jaeger ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, Kafka Connect, and the Kafka clients all expose management information using Java Management Extensions (JMX) . Most management information is in the form of metrics that are useful for monitoring the condition and performance of your Kafka cluster. Like other Java applications, Kafka provides this management information through managed beans or MBeans. JMX works at the level of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). To obtain management information, external tools can connect to the JVM that is running ZooKeeper, the Kafka broker, and so on. By default, only tools on the same machine and running as the same user as the JVM are able to connect. Distributed Tracing with Jaeger: - Kafka Producers, Kafka Consumers, and Kafka Streams applications (referred to as Kafka clients) - MirrorMaker and Kafka Connect - Kafka Bridge ref1 , ref2 Red Hat AMQ Streams Operator AMQ Streams Operator (Prometheus & Jaeger), strimzi, jmxtrans How to monitor AMQ Streams Kafka, Zookeeper and Kafka Connect clusters using Prometheus to provide monitoring data for example Grafana dashboards. Support for distributed tracing in AMQ Streams, using Jaeger : - You instrument Kafka Producer, Consumer, and Streams API applications for distributed tracing using an OpenTracing client library. This involves adding instrumentation code to these clients, which monitors the execution of individual transactions in order to generate trace data. - Distributed tracing support is built in to the Kafka Connect, MirrorMaker, and Kafka Bridge components of AMQ Streams. To configure these components for distributed tracing, you configure and update the relevant custom resources. ref1 , ref2 , ref3 strimzi , ref4: jmxtrans , ref5: banzai operator Red Hat AMQ Broker Operator Prometheus (recommended) or Jolokia REST to JMX To monitor runtime data for brokers in your deployment, use one of these approaches: - Section 9.1, \u201cMonitoring broker runtime data using Prometheus\u201d - Section 9.2, \u201cMonitoring broker runtime data using JMX\u201d In general, using Prometheus is the recommended approach. However, you might choose to use the Jolokia REST interface to JMX if a metric that you need to monitor is not exported by the Prometheus plugin.

OpenShift : Wide enterprise adoption Security Multi-tenancy features (self-service) OpenShift 4 is built on top of Kubernetes 1.13+ Roadmap Release Notes Three New Functionalities \u00b6 Self-Managing Platform Application Lifecycle Management ( OLM ): OLM Operator : Responsible for deploying applications defined by ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) manifest . Not concerned with the creation of the required resources; users can choose to manually create these resources using the CLI, or users can choose to create these resources using the Catalog Operator. Catalog Operator : Responsible for resolving and installing CSVs and the required resources they specify. It is also responsible for watching CatalogSources for updates to packages in channels and upgrading them (optionally automatically) to the latest available versions. A user that wishes to track a package in a channel creates a Subscription resource configuring the desired package, channel, and the CatalogSource from which to pull updates. When updates are found, an appropriate InstallPlan is written into the namespace on behalf of the user. Automated Infrastructure Management ( Over-The-Air Updates ) New Technical Components \u00b6 New Installer : try.openshift.com github.com/openshift/installer Storage: Cloud integrated storage capability used by default via OCS Operator (Red Hat) There are a number of persistent storage options available to you through the OperatorHub / Storage vendors that don\u2019t involve Red Hat, NFS or Gluster. Kubernetes-native persistent storage technologies available (non-RedHat solutions): Rook-Ceph : Rook-Ceph storage Operator now on OperatorHub.io Robin Storage Operator : get.robin.io Operators End-To-End!: responsible for reconciling the system to the desired state Cluster configuration kept as API objects that ease its maintenance (\u201ceverything-as-code\u201d approach): Every component is configured with Custom Resources (CR) that are processed by operators. No more painful upgrades and synchronization among multiple nodes and no more configuration drift. List of operators that configure cluster components (API objects): API server Nodes via Machine API Ingress Internal DNS Logging (EFK) and Monitoring (Prometheus) Sample applications Networking Internal Registry Oauth (and authentication in general) etc At the Node Level: RHEL CoreOS is the result of merging CoreOS Container Linux and RedHat Atomic host functionality and is currently the only supported OS to host OpenShift 4. Node provisioning with ignition , which came with CoreOS Container Linux Atomic host updates with rpm-ostree CRI-O as a container runtime SELinux enabled by default Machine API : Provisioning of nodes. Abstraction mechanism added (API objects to declaratively manage the cluster): Based on Kubernetes Cluster API project Provides a new set of machine resources: Machine Machine Deployment MachineSet: distributes easily your nodes among different Availability Zones manages multiple node pools (e.g. pool for testing, pool for machine learning with GPU attached, etc) Everything \u201cjust another pod\u201d Installation & Cluster Autoscaler \u00b6 New installer openshift-install tool, replacement for the old Ansible scripts. 40 min (AWS). Terraform. 2 installation patterns: Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI) User Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI) The whole process can be done in one command and requires minimal infrastructure knowledge (IPI): openshift-install create cluster IPI & UPI \u00b6 2 installation patterns: Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI): On supported platforms, the installer is capable of provisioning the underlying infrastructure for the cluster. The installer programmatically creates all portions of the networking, machines, and operating systems required to support the cluster. Think of it as best-practice reference architecture implemented in code. It is recommended that most users make use of this functionality to avoid having to provision their own infrastructure. The installer will create and destroy the infrastructure components it needs to be successful over the life of the cluster. User Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI): For other platforms or in scenarios where installer provisioned infrastructure would be incompatible, the installer can stop short of creating the infrastructure, and allow the platform administrator to provision their own using the cluster assets generated by the install tool. Once the infrastructure has been created, OpenShift 4 is installed, maintaining its ability to support automated operations and over-the-air platform updates. Cluster Autoscaler Operator \u00b6 Adjusts the size of an OpenShift Container Platform cluster to meet its current deployment needs. It uses declarative, Kubernetes-style arguments Increases the size of the cluster when there are pods that failed to schedule on any of the current nodes due to insufficient resources or when another node is necessary to meet deployment needs. The ClusterAutoscaler does not increase the cluster resources beyond the limits that you specify. A huge improvement over the manual, error-prone process used in the previous version of OpenShift and RHEL nodes. Operators \u00b6 Introduction \u00b6 Core of the platform The hierarchy of operators, with clusterversion at the top, is the single door for configuration changes and is responsible for reconciling the system to the desired state. For example, if you break a critical cluster resource directly, the system automatically recovers itself. Similarly to cluster maintenance, operator framework used for applications. As a user, you get SDK, OLM (Lifecycle Manager of all Operators and their associated services running across their clusters) and embedded operator hub . OLM Arquitecture Adding Operators to a Cluster (They can be added via CatalogSource ) The supported method of using Helm charts with Openshift is via the Helm Operator twitter.com/operatorhubio View the list of Operators available to the cluster from the OperatorHub: $ oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace NAME AGE amq-streams 14h packageserver 15h couchbase-enterprise 14h mongodb-enterprise 14h etcd 14h myoperator 14h ... Catalog \u00b6 Developer Catalog Installed Operators OperatorHub (OLM) Operator Management: Operator Catalogs are groups of Operators you can make available on the cluster. They can be added via CatalogSource (i.e. \u201ccatalogsource.yaml\u201d). Subscribe and grant a namespace access to use the installed Operators. Operator Subscriptions keep your services up to date by tracking a channel in a package. The approval strategy determines either manual or automatic updates.

The Operator upgrades and monitors the cluster network. Router plug-ins in OCP3: A \u00ab route \u00bb is the external entrypoint to a Kubernetes Service . This is one of the biggest differences between Kubernetes and OpenShift Enterprise (= OCP) and origin . OpenShift router has the endpoints as targets and therefore the pod of the application. Shared/Stikcy sessions are enabled by default HAProxy template router (default router): HTTP(s) & TLS-enabled traffic via SIN. dzone.com/articles/updating-haproxy-configurations-openshift dzone.com/articles/openshift-egress-options F5 BIG-IP Router plug-in integrates with an existing F5 BIG-IP system in your environment Since the 9th May 2018, NGINX is also available as \u00ab router \u00bb. Routers in OCP4: Ingress Controller is the most common way to allow external access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster Configuring Ingress Operator in OCP4 Limited to HTTP, HTTPS using SNI, and TLS using SNI (sufficient for web applications and services) Has two replicas by default, which means it should be running on two worker nodes. Can be scaled up to have more replicas on more nodes. The Ingress Operator implements the ingresscontroller API and is the component responsible for enabling external access to OpenShift Container Platform cluster services. The operator makes this possible by deploying and managing one or more HAProxy-based Ingress Controllers to handle routing.

The OpenShift Container Platform cluster logging solution requires that you install both the Cluster Logging Operator and Elasticsearch Operator . There is no use case in OpenShift Container Platform for installing the operators individually. You must install the Elasticsearch Operator using the CLI following the directions below. You can install the Cluster Logging Operator using the web console or CLI. Deployment procedure based on CLI + web console: docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.html Elasticsearch Operator must be installed in Project \u201copenshift-operators-redhat\u201d Cluster Logging Operator must be deployed in Project \u201copenshift-logging\u201d CatalogSourceConfig added to enable Elasticsearch Operator on the cluster etc. OCP Release Elasticsearch Fluentd Kibana EFK deployed by default OpenShift 3.11 5.6.13.6 0.12.43 5.6.13 No OpenShift 4.1 5.6.16 ? 5.6.16 No Build Images. Next-Generation Container Image Building Tools \u00b6 Redesign of how images are built on the platform. Instead of relying on a daemon on the host to manage containers, image creation, and image pushing, we are leveraging Buildah running inside our build pods. This aligns with the general OpenShift 4 theme of making everything \u201cjust another pod\u201d A simplified set of build workflows, not dependent on the node host having a specific container runtime available. Dockerfiles that built under OpenShift 3.x will continue to build under OpenShift 4.x and S2I builds will continue to function as well. The actual BuildConfig API is unchanged, so a BuildConfig from a v3.x cluster can be imported into a v4.x cluster and work without modification. Podman & Buildah for docker users Openshift ImageStreams Openshift 4 image builds Custom image builds with Buildah Rootless podman and NFS Registry & Quay \u00b6 A Docker registry is a place to store and distribute Docker images. It serves as a target for your docker push and docker pull commands. Openshift ImageStreams The registry is now managed by an Operator instead of oc adm registry. Quay.io is a hosted Docker registry from CoreOS: Main features: \u201cPowerful build triggers\u201d \u201cAdvanced team permissions\u201d \u201cSecure storage\u201d One of the more enterprise-friendly options out there, offering fine-grained permission controls. They support any git server and let you build advanced workflows by doing things like mapping git branches to Docker tags so that when you commit code it automatically builds a corresponding image. Quay offers unlimited free public repositories. Otherwise, you pay by the number of private repositories. There\u2019s no extra charge for storage or bandwidth. Quay 3.0 released in May 2019 : support for multiple architectures, Windows containers, and a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) -based image to this container image registry. Quay 3.1 released in September 2019 : The newest Quay feature is repository mirroring, which complements our existing geographic replication features. Repository mirroring reflects content between distinct, different registries. With this, you can synchronize whitelisted repositories or a source registry subset into Quay. This makes it much easier to distribute images and related data through Quay.

Security Context Constraints Dzone: Understanding OpenShift Security Context Constraints Review Security Context Constraints \u00b6 Security Context Constraints (SCCs) control what actions pods can perform and what resources they can access. SCCs combine a set of security configurations into a single policy object that can be applied to pods. These security configurations include, but are not limited to, Linux Capabilities, Seccomp Profiles, User and Group ID Ranges, and types of mounts. OpenShift ships with several SCCs. The most constrained is the restricted SCC, and the least constrained in the privileged SCC. The other SCCs provide intermediate levels of constraint for various use cases. The restricted SCC is granted to all authenticated users by default. The default SCC for most pods should be the restricted SCC. If required, a cluster administrator may allow certain pods to run with different SCCs. Pods should be run with the most restrictive SCC possible. Pods inherit their SCC from the Service Account used to run the pod. With the default project template, new projects get a Service Account named default that is used to run pods. This default service account is only granted the ability to run the restricted SCC. Recommendations: Use OpenShift\u2019s Security Context Constraint feature, which has been contributed to Kubernetes as Pod Security Policies . PSPs are still beta in Kubernetes 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12. Use the restricted SCC as the default For pods that require additional access, use the SCC that grants the least amount of additional privileges or create a custom SCC Audit To show all available SCCs: oc describe scc To audit a single pod: oc describe pod <POD> | grep openshift.io\\/scc Remediation: Apply the SCC with the least privilege required OpenShift Network Model & Network Policy \u00b6 docs.openshift.com: Understanding networking docs.openshift.com: Configuring network policy with OpenShift SDN NetworkPolicies and Microsegmentation Fully Automated Management of Egress IPs with the egressip-ipam-operator \ud83c\udf1f GitHub: redhat-cop OpenShift Toolkit Network Policy \ud83c\udf1f Network Security Zones \u00b6 stackoverflow.com: Is that possible to deploy an openshift or kubernetes in DMZ zone? \ud83c\udf1f OpenShift and Network Security Zones: Coexistence Approaches \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f Introduction: Kubernetes and consequently OpenShift adopt a flat Software Defined Network (SDN) model , which means that all pods in the SDN are in the same logical network. Traditional network implementations adopt a zoning model in which different networks or zones are dedicated to specific purposes, with very strict communication rules between each zone. When implementing OpenShift in organizations that are using network security zones, the two models may clash. In this article, we will analyze a few options for coexistence. But first, let\u2019s understand the two network models a bit more in depth. Network Zones have been the widely accepted approach for building security into a network architecture. The general idea is to create separate networks, each with a specific purpose. Each network contains devices with similar security profiles. Communications between networks is highly scrutinized and controlled by firewall rules ( perimeter defense ). Conclusion: A company\u2019s security organization must be involved when deciding how to deploy OpenShift with regard to traditional network zones. Depending on their level of comfort with new technologies you may have different options. If physical network separation is the only acceptable choice, you will have to build a cluster per network zone. If logical network type of separations can be considered, then there are ways to stretch a single OpenShift deployment across multiple network zones. This post presented a few technical approaches.

SCCs combine a set of security configurations into a single policy object that can be applied to pods. These security configurations include, but are not limited to, Linux Capabilities, Seccomp Profiles, User and Group ID Ranges, and types of mounts. OpenShift ships with several SCCs. The most constrained is the restricted SCC, and the least constrained in the privileged SCC. The other SCCs provide intermediate levels of constraint for various use cases. The restricted SCC is granted to all authenticated users by default. The default SCC for most pods should be the restricted SCC. If required, a cluster administrator may allow certain pods to run with different SCCs. Pods should be run with the most restrictive SCC possible. Pods inherit their SCC from the Service Account used to run the pod. With the default project template, new projects get a Service Account named default that is used to run pods. This default service account is only granted the ability to run the restricted SCC. Recommendations: Use OpenShift\u2019s Security Context Constraint feature, which has been contributed to Kubernetes as Pod Security Policies . PSPs are still beta in Kubernetes 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12. Use the restricted SCC as the default For pods that require additional access, use the SCC that grants the least amount of additional privileges or create a custom SCC Audit To show all available SCCs: oc describe scc To audit a single pod: oc describe pod <POD> | grep openshift.io\\/scc Remediation: Apply the SCC with the least privilege required","title":"Review Security Context Constraints"},{"location":"openshift/#openshift-network-model-network-policy","text":"docs.openshift.com: Understanding networking docs.openshift.com: Configuring network policy with OpenShift SDN NetworkPolicies and Microsegmentation Fully Automated Management of Egress IPs with the egressip-ipam-operator \ud83c\udf1f GitHub: redhat-cop OpenShift Toolkit Network Policy \ud83c\udf1f","title":"OpenShift Network Model &amp; Network Policy"},{"location":"openshift/#network-security-zones","text":"stackoverflow.com: Is that possible to deploy an openshift or kubernetes in DMZ zone? \ud83c\udf1f OpenShift and Network Security Zones: Coexistence Approaches \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f Introduction: Kubernetes and consequently OpenShift adopt a flat Software Defined Network (SDN) model , which means that all pods in the SDN are in the same logical network. Traditional network implementations adopt a zoning model in which different networks or zones are dedicated to specific purposes, with very strict communication rules between each zone. When implementing OpenShift in organizations that are using network security zones, the two models may clash. In this article, we will analyze a few options for coexistence. But first, let\u2019s understand the two network models a bit more in depth. Network Zones have been the widely accepted approach for building security into a network architecture. The general idea is to create separate networks, each with a specific purpose. Each network contains devices with similar security profiles. Communications between networks is highly scrutinized and controlled by firewall rules ( perimeter defense ). Conclusion: A company\u2019s security organization must be involved when deciding how to deploy OpenShift with regard to traditional network zones. Depending on their level of comfort with new technologies you may have different options. If physical network separation is the only acceptable choice, you will have to build a cluster per network zone. If logical network type of separations can be considered, then there are ways to stretch a single OpenShift deployment across multiple network zones.
