## Git Repositories Structures
- [GitOps: How to Ops Your Git the Right Way üåü](https://dzone.com/articles/gitops-how-to-ops-your-git-the-right-way) In this article we‚Äôll look into the specifics of creating Git repositories structures ‚Ää‚Äî ‚Ääthe very core of the GitOps approach.

### Jenkins
- There are many tools in the market that have been technically built for GitOps, like [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux), and [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/). All these tools have in-built proficiency to implement GitOps process for you. But we are going to use our old beloved Jenkins.
