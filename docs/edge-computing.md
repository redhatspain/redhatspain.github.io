- [cloudflare.com: What Is Edge Computing?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/serverless/glossary/what-is-edge-computing/) Edge computing optimizes internet devices and web applications by bringing computing closer to the source of the data. This minimizes the need for long distance communications between client and server, which reduces latency and bandwidth usage.
