# YAML Processors
- [wikipedia: YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)
- You should use tools such as [yq](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/) and kustomize to template YAML resources instead of relying on tools that interpolate strings such as [Helm](https://helm.sh/). 
- [yq](https://mikefarah.gitbook.io/yq/) is a lightweight and portable command-line YAML processor. The aim of the project is to be the [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) or sed of yaml files.
- [ytt](https://get-ytt.io/) is a templating tool that understands YAML structure allowing you to focus on your data instead of how to properly escape it.
