- [Find the fastest region from your location](http://aws-latency.altaircp.com/) Check AWS response time from you browser. Sharing my mini-project, it measures response time from AWS services from different regions base on your location. let me know what you think.
- [Linkedin Discussion](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/49531/49531-6092152919937794052)
>1. Don't do just a single check, the first check will be a lot slower as DNS lookups will need to be done, etc.
>2. I'd recommend doing at least 3 checks getting an average.
- Run 6 checks (with a random 3-10 second delay between each one), the first can be ignored, the highest one is also ignored (as a likely outlier), then for the next 4 show the minimum, maximum and average (mean).
